## Overview

ToolJet is an open-source low-code framework to build and deploy internal tools quickly without much effort from the engineering teams. You can connect to your data sources, such as databases (like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, etc), API endpoints (ToolJet supports importing OpenAPI spec & OAuth2 authorization), and external services (like Stripe, Slack, Google Sheets, Airtable) and use our pre-built UI widgets to build internal tools.

### Features

- *Visual app builder:* 35+ built-in responsive widgets such as Tables, Charts, Lists, Forms, Progressbars, and more.
- *20+ data sources:* connect to databases, cloud storages and APIs.
- *Desktop & mobile*: ;layout widths can be customised to support different screens. 
- *Collaborate:* add comments anywhere on the canvas and tag your team members.
- *Extend with plugins:*: use our [commandline tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tooljet) to easily boostrap new connectors.
- *Version control:* every application have different versions with proper release cycle.
- *Run JS code:* ability custom JavaScript snippets

- *low-code:* write JS code almost anywhere in the builder. For example, the color property of text can be set to `status === 'success' ? 'green' : 'red'`
- *no-code query editors* for all supported data sources.
